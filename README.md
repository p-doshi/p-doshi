# hey, i’m parth 👋

currently figuring out how to make machines a bit less dumb  
cs @ dalhousie | building things with ai, data, and way too many open tabs (I assure you, its way too many)

---

## what i’m working on

- 🛳️ **vessel trajectory modeling** — generative + physics-based approaches to predict how ships move  
- 🌍 **ais data pipelines** — denoising, segmenting, and interpolating satellite and marine signals  
- ⚡ **low-power systems on jetson nano** — building schedulers to survive with minimal power  
- 🧠 **bci signal decoding** — EEG signals, SSVEP classification, occipital lobe focus

## what i like doing

- asking dumb questions until something makes sense  
- turning raw data into something usable  
- mixing science with ML research  
- building tools that don’t break when no one’s looking  
- shipping messy stuff, improving later

---

## stack (mostly)

**code**: python, java, c++  
**ml**: pytorch, tflite, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn  
**infra**: docker, fastify, zarr  
**viz**: matplotlib, seaborn, leaflet, plotly  
**misc**: gdal, shapely, geopy, opencv, jetson hacks

---

## experience / projects

- 🧪 **deepsense** – marine ml intern: vessel detection, remote sensing, trajectory modeling  
- 🔬 **maps lab** – research assistant: bci signal processing and SSVEP decoding  
- 🛠️ **project mantis** – ai systems for marine intel + automation  
- 🧰 **vesselviz**, **NurseNavigator**, **steadylinestabilizer**, and other odd tools

---

## open source + collab

contributed to:
- `aisdb` (vessel data handling + encoding)
- random smaller tools (data cleaning, visualization, some opencv utils)

- 🏓 if i’m not coding, i’m probably at **CCubed** (come say hi)

## last thing

not trying to be the smartest in the room. just want to build good things with curious people.
